Before I delve into my ideas for a perfect state. I would like to introduce these series of articles, which I hopefully can complete to write out my thoughts on administration of a modern state.

I write this at 9:15 pm 5th June 2020. The world has been through a pandemic, devastating lives and livelihoods across the worlds. Protests have erupted in the United States over a sad death of an African American. The Chinese released new declarations extending their security laws to Hong Kong. The Indians are hoping to come out of this pandemic, while staring at the end at an uncertain economic future. The Russians, where surprisingly coronavirus cases have spread rapidly, rolled out a coordinated surveillance system in Moscow under the pretense of combating the virus.

And I happened to watch an interesting video by Marques Brownlee. He talked about his experience of staying silent about the treatment of African Americans. I wondered, maybe I should put my thoughts into the world. For what they are worth. I am not a political scientist.

I am a student of Computer Science. I create frameworks, communication channels, create systems which manage resources and information. These frameworks have to be secure, robust, prone to logical fallacies. If this sounds similar, this is exactly what an administration does. I simply want to explore, what is administration, why an administration, what should an administration hope to achieve.

I am not delving into politics. These articles are not about how one comes into power, but rather how should a state function irrespective of people constituting the state.

Perhaps, these articles may not be read by anyone. I will still be satisfied, knowing there are out there in the world.
