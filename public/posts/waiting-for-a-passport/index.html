      Waiting for a Passport

  <div class="post-content"><p><em>Views expressed below are solely mine and do not reflect views of any affiliated institution or persons.</em></p>
<p>I did not expect to be writing this post. The short story is I applied to renew my passport at the Indian consulate 2 months ago. I have not received my passport yet and I am scheduled to attend the AAAI conference in Singapore to present my paper &ldquo;Quiet Feature Learning in Algorithmic Tasks&rdquo;. Clearly I will be unable to do so.</p>
<p>Looking back in 2025, one of my favourite moments of the year was when an old American lady said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Indian. They are gentlemen.&rdquo; Tears welled up in my eyes. I came to the US in August 2016 (almost a decade ago) when I was 17. I soon realized, I will no longer be Prudhvi. I will be Indian first. Every time I met someone, for them they were meeting an Indian. After we would talk for a few days would they meet Prudhvi.</p>
<p>So I straightened my back, put on a friendly smile and tried to be the best Indian I could be. Every conversation felt like I was carrying the Indian flag. Stopping it from falling in the mud. I am sure I didn&rsquo;t meet the high standards in every social interaction. Nonetheless I would try each time. Because a part of me believed that no matter what the reality may be, if I strived for excellence as an Indian, India would follow too.</p>
<p>It seems such a foolish belief now. But in my heart, I genuinely believed that as long as I held myself to excellence, 1.5 billion other humans would too. Over the past decade as I came to understand the realities of governments and politics, that belief was tempered by reality but it persisted. It persisted because the forts in Maharashtra stood tall after centuries of monsoons. It persisted because Mumbaikars still went about their day while their public infrastructure crumbled. It persisted because I was still naive.</p>
<p>I did not ask for any grand acts of justice from the Indian government. A passport is a document certifying a person is a citizen of a country. This was my third passport, not even my first. My lineage does not come from any distant land. As far as I know, my ancestors were in India before the times of Ashoka.</p>
<p>I know this is not even a big offence by the Indian government. It is not like I am stuck revolving between Indian courts after being robbed. Even worse, the government could have charged me with sedition. I know this is at best a minor inconvenience in the eyes of others. But to me, it is about the belief that if I act with excellence then others will reciprocate by acting with excellence in their roles.</p>
<p>When I started this post, I intended to quote the constitution on what being Indian means. How that differs from what India now represents. And whether the principles of India as I had come to understand them even ever applied in practice. But arguing those points means I still believe in India. There is a great point from the NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani: if the city can&rsquo;t fix minor issues like not installing speed bumps, why would the citizens believe in anything more.</p>
<p>If the government can&rsquo;t issue passports on time (or communicate the reason for the failure to do so), why would I believe in any of its grandiose promises.</p>
<p>In India, people always say &ldquo;Everything that happens, happens for your own good.&rdquo; At a glance, I found this statement incredibly infuriating. Now, I find it sad. The statement implies that there is no action someone can take to get to a desirable state. Hence, one must find happiness in the state they are in, no matter how dystopian. It reflects well in the ideas of karma and our caste system. Things are right and fair because they happen in our current reality, not that we must endeavour to change our circumstances to make them fairer.</p>
<p>This attitude reflects millennia of feudalism, casteism, racism, colonialism, patriarchy, and other social injustice words I may be unaware of. No matter how unfair you may believe your present is, the Indian view is that your belief must change, not your present.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast with the American view, which simply believes the world must change but they will not change their belief. It says something about the ability to shape the world based on principles. Some of those principles may be misguided or unfair. But nonetheless, the alternative is to lie bare for the world to trample upon us. As such, I have chosen to believe in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom of movement of labour</li>
<li>Freedom of movement of capital / goods / services</li>
</ol>
<p>I wholeheartedly believe in the pursuit of these two principles along with other well-established principles in the free world. I have now come to view the above two as necessary to eliminate poverty and human suffering around the world (not just within the country that pursues them). When I look back at this post after a decade or two, I hope to be able to say I acted in accordance in pursuit of those principles.</p>
