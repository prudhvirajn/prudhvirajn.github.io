The packets of Internet used to pilgrimage through the telephone line before being rendered on the dusty CRT monitor desktop. To ensure safe passage, upon starting the computer, one used an application on the computer to setup a dial-up connection to the ISP. If god forbids, one of my relatives decided to call unannounced, I would loose my internet connection when my mother decided to answer the phone. At that time you see, call packets (and my mother’s conversations with distant relatives) were given preference to my humble internet packets (my net surfing time). One day he brought in the router, which safe-guarded my internet connection against my mother’s tyrannical conversations. The router also had a wireless connection option. The idea that packets of information could float through the air carrying videos blew my mind away. I could sit in peace undistrubted by the tyranny of the telephone.\nBut this is my earliest memory of being astounded by technology.
