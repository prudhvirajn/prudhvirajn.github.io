Sisyphus is a mortal condemned by Zeus to push a boulder up a slope. When he reaches the top of the slope, the boulder automatically falls down and he has to start again. Sounds like a nightmare right? A work that is never completed?
When sisyphus is pushing the boulder, he has only one thing on his mind. To push the boulder up. Why should he push the boulder up? Because the gods commanded it. The ultimate reason: The wishes of the divine. So he had reason and he had a goal thus he had meaning in his work. But what about when the boulder reaches the top? Imagine if the boulder never fell back down. Would he still have meaning? How would he find meaning?">
