Hi, My name is Prudhviraj Naidu.

I am a junior B.S Comp Sci @ University of Cincinnati.

I work on Computer Vision, Machine Learning problems.

I have ideas, and no one to listen to them.

So I put them on this blog. 

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/prudhvirajn) or [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/prudhviraj-naidu-b9673913a).
